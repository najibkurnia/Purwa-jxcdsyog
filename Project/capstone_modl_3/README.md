# Context E-COMMERCE CUSTOMER CHURN

datasets from e-commerce platforms with the primary objective of predicting customer churn, which is customers who stop shopping or using services from the platform. This process involves the use of machine learning techniques to build an accurate predictive model. The main focus of this project is not only to create a model that is able to identify customers who are likely to churn, but also to understand the main factors that influence their decision to stop shopping. Thus, the developed model is expected to provide valuable insights that can be used by the management team in designing strategies to improve the overall customer retention rate
# Problem Statement
Although e-commerce platforms have implemented various marketing and promotional strategies, customer churn remains a major concern. Increasing customer retention is a major challenge in e-commerce. Currently, high customer churn rates lead to decreased revenue and difficulty in maintaining market share. Therefore, an in-depth analysis of the factors that influence customer churn is needed so that loyalty strategies can be developed effectively
# Goals
Provides a very useful overview of the factors that influence churn and business strategies can be focused on the most influential features
